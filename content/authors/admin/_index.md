I just finished my master's studies in Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics at the Technical University of Munich and am now looking for work opportunities in the life sciences field. 

Through a bachelor's degree in Engineering Science, I acquired fundamental skills in mathematics, physics, and computer science, as well as engineering skills such as CAD-modelling and control engineering.
In my graduate studies, I specialized in microfluidics and biosensing technology. Spending the one-year research phase of my master's thesis in a synthetic biology lab allowed me to dive deep into droplet microfluidics and its applications for engineering biology. As part of my thesis, I developed a microfluidic picoinjector and used it to investigate the interaction between bacteria and bacteriophages in droplets. In the process, I used micromanufacturing technologies such as photolithography, fluorescence microscopy, and fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS).

Besides engineering, I have some background in bioinformatics, which I studied in a second bachelor's degree. Though I later moved back to engineering, this experience allowed me to collect valuable data analysis, AI, and coding skills.
